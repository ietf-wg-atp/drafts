--- abstract

This document specifies the repository semantics for Authenticated Transfer (AT), a protocol for cryptographically-verifiable storage and distribution of structured user-controlled data. It defines the AT repository that serves as the fundamental data storage model.

This document specifically deals with the repository structure and format. Overall network architecture is described further in {{AT-ARCH}}.

# Introduction {#user-id}

The Authenticated Transfer (AT) repository addresses the challenges of building decentralized applications that require consistent data replication across distributed multi-party infrastructure. Traditional web platforms maintain user data at a single network location, creating vendor lock-in and limiting user agency over their digital identity and published content.

In the AT model, user data is stored in cryptographically signed repositories that can be hosted, synchronized, and distributed by any compatible server while preserving data authenticity and user ownership. Each repository consists of a set of CBOR-encoded objects called records, organized lexicographically by type. The cryptographic structure allows repository contents to be re-distributed and cached by any network participant without requiring trust in intermediary hosts.


An AT repository provides a sorted key-value interface where values are CBOR-encoded objects referred to as records. Applications interact with repositories through standard CRUD operations while the underlying Merkle tree structure enables cryptographic verification of all modifications.

Repository authority is established through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Each repository is associated with exactly one DID, which resolves to the cryptographic key material necessary for verifying repositories.

This document describes version `3` of the AT repository format. Both previous versions are deprecated, and implementations do not need to support them.

# Repository Semantics {#repo-semantics}

Records are discrete units of user data, each CBOR-encoded and identified by a unique key within the repository. The repository is schema-agnostic and provides the foundational layer for higher-level data models and application semantics.

Repositories support individual record operations as well as batch writes that group multiple operations under a single commit, or signed mutation, to the repository. Implementations should apply practical limits on batch sizes to support efficient processing and distribution of repository changes.

# Repository Paths and Record Keys {#repo-paths}

Records within a repository are identified by a non-empty ASCII byte string composed of a collection identifier and a record key. This section specifies the syntax for collections, record keys, and the combined path.

## Collection Identifiers (NSIDs) {#collections}

Collections are identified by a Namespaced Identifier (NSID): an ASCII string in reverse domain-name order followed by an additional name segment. The portion preceding the final segment is the **domain authority**; the final segment is the **name**.

NSIDs MUST conform to the following syntax:

- Overall:
    - MUST contain only ASCII characters
    - MUST separate the domain authority and the name by an ASCII period (`.`)
    - MUST contain at least three segments
    - MUST be at most 317 characters in total length
- Domain authority:
    - Composed of segments separated by ASCII periods (`.`)
    - At most 253 characters in total (including periods), and at least two segments
    - Each segment MUST contain at least 1 and at most 63 characters
    - The allowed characters are ASCII letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`), digits (`0-9`), and hyphens (`-`)
    - Segments MUST NOT start or end with a hyphen
    - The first segment (the top-level domain) MUST NOT start with a digit
    - The domain authority is not case-sensitive and SHOULD be normalized to lowercase
- Name:
    - MUST contain at least 1 and at most 63 characters
    - The allowed characters are ASCII letters and digits only (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)
    - Hyphens are not allowed
    - MUST NOT start with a digit
    - Case-sensitive; implementations MUST NOT normalize case

## Record Keys {#record-keys}

A record key uniquely identifies a record within a collection. Record keys MUST satisfy the following syntax:

- Length between 1 and 512 characters
- Allowed characters are ASCII alphanumerics (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`), period (`.`), hyphen (`-`), underscore (`_`), colon (`:`), and tilde (`~`)
- Case-sensitive
- The literal values `.` and `..` are not valid record keys
- MUST be a valid path component as defined in Section 3.3 of {{RFC3986}} (the character set above already satisfies this)

This specification does not constrain which record-key scheme is used. In practice, deployments most commonly use Timestamp Identifiers ({{tids}}) for record keys to obtain temporal locality in the tree.

## Repository Paths {#paths}

A repository path is the combination of a collection identifier and a record key joined by a single forward slash: `<collection>/<record-key>`

A path MUST consist of exactly two segments separated by `/`, with no leading or trailing slash. The combined path string is the byte string used as the MST key.

By convention, records sharing a collection identifier sort adjacently within the repository. Repository efficiency, especially when producing cryptographic proofs for a subset of records, benefits from grouping related records around lexicographically similar keys. This grouping allows for structural sharing within the repository data structure and reduces cryptographic proof sizes.

# Repository Structure {#repo-structure}

AT repositories are organized as a [Merkle Search Tree](https://inria.hal.science/hal-02303490/document) ({{MST}}) with a cryptographically signed commit referencing the tree root.

The MST provides several fundamental properties for repository operations. As a content-addressed structure, it enables efficient verification of data. The MST maintains lexicographic key ordering, enabling structural sharing of intermediate tree nodes for related records. It is probabilistically self-balancing, offering consistent performance characteristics. Additionally the MST exhibits unicity, meaning that any given set of keys and values will always produce the same tree structure and root hash regardless of insertion order.

Repository contents are encoded using deterministic CBOR serialization and organized as a directed acyclic graph where data objects reference each other through content hashes. These hash-identified data objects, referred to as "blocks," include three distinct types: commit objects, MST internal nodes, and user records.

Large binary data such as images and media files are not stored directly within repositories. Instead, such data is stored externally and referenced in records by a hash link.

# Account Identifiers {#account-ids}

Repository authority is established through a resolvable account identifier specified in the repository commit ({{commits}}). AT currently employs Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as defined in {{DID}} for this purpose.

DIDs are globally unique identifiers that resolve to DID Documents containing cryptographic key material and other metadata associated with the identifier. Resolution enables independent verification of repository commits without dependence on centralized authorities.

Each repository MUST reference exactly one account identifier, and each account identifier MAY be associated with at most one AT repository.

The signing key for repository commits is specified within the DID document's `verificationMethod` array. The key entry must have an `id` field ending in `#atproto`. When multiple possible verification methods are present, implementations must use the first valid entry and ignore subsequent ones. The public key must be encoded using the `publicKeyMultibase` format as specified in {{CONTROLLEDID}}. The signing key must use one of the signing algorithms described in {{sig-curves}}.

Resolution MAY return supplementary information beyond the signing key, including canonical repository hosting locations, alternative account identifiers, or relevant service endpoints.

To ensure interoperability, AT currently restricts support to specific DID methods: `did:web` and `did:plc`. The resolution mechanisms and specifications for these methods are described in {{DIDWEB}} and {{DIDPLC}}.

# Commit Objects {#commits}

Commit objects serve as the authoritative root of each repository, establishing cryptographic ownership and providing a verifiable reference to the state of a repository at a particular point in time. Each commit is digitally signed by the repository owner and contains metadata necessary for verification.

A commit object contains the following data fields:

- **`did`** (string, required): The resolvable account identifier associated with the repository as described in {{account-ids}}
- **`version`** (integer, required): Repository format version, fixed value of **`3`** for the current specification
- **`data`** (hash link, required): Hash pointer to the root of the repository’s MST structure
- **`rev`** (string, required): Repository revision identifier that functions as a logical clock and must increase monotonically (see {{revs}}).
- **`prev`** (hash link, nullable): Optional pointer to the previous commit object in the repository's history chain. While included for backward compatibility with version 2 repositories, this field is typically `null` in version 3 implementations
- **`sig`** (byte array, required): Cryptographic signature over the commit contents.

Commit signature generation and verification procedures are detailed in {{sig-gen}}.

# Repository Revisions {#revs}

Each repository maintains a `rev` field (short for “revision”) that functions as a logical clock for the progression of the contents of the repository over time. The revision value is a short string value that must increase lexicographically with each new commit.

Revisions may be used when comparing two repositories, especially when obtained from a non-canonical host, to determine which is more recent.

## Timestamp Identifier Format {#tids}

The recommended mechanism for generating revision values is the Timestamp Identifier (TID) format.

TIDs provide a standardized revision format with the following properties:

- 64-bit integer with big-endian byte ordering
- Base32-sortable encoding using characters `234567abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- Fixed 13-character length with no padding (integer zero encodes as `2222222222222`)

The layout of the 64-bit integer is:

- The top bit is always 0
- The next 53 bits represent microseconds since the UNIX epoch. 53 bits is chosen as the maximum safe integer precision in a 64-bit floating point number, as used by Javascript.
- The final 10 bits are a random "clock identifier."

# MST Construction {#mst}

The MST structure is deterministically reproducible from any given key-value mapping, where keys are non-empty byte strings and values are hash link references to records. This deterministic construction ensures that identical input sets always produce the same root hash regardless of insertion order.

The tree's structural organization depends solely on the keys present, not on the record values they reference. When a record value changes, the new content hash propagates up through the tree nodes to the root, but the tree's shape and node organization remain unchanged.

## Tree Structure {#mst-structure}

Each MST node contains a list of key-value entries and references to child subtrees. Entries and subtree links are maintained in lexicographic order, with all keys in a linked subtree falling within the range corresponding to that link's position. The ordering proceeds from left (lexicographically first) to right (lexicographically last).

Keys are assigned to tree levels based on a layer value computed from the key itself. Nodes at each level contain all keys with the corresponding layer value, while subtree links point to nodes containing keys that fall within specific lexicographic ranges but have lower layer values. Adjacent keys may appear within the same node, but adjacent subtrees must be separated by at least one key entry to prevent structural ambiguity.

## Layer Calculation {#mst-layer}

The layer for a given key is calculated using SHA-256 with a 2-bit grouping scheme that provides an average fanout of 4:

1. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the key (byte string) with binary output
2. Count the number of leading binary zeros in the hash
3. Divide by 2, rounding down to the nearest integer

Examples of layer calculation:

- `key1`: SHA-256 begins `100000010111...` → layer 0
- `key7`: SHA-256 begins `000111100011...` → layer 1
- `key515`: SHA-256 begins `000000000111...` → layer 4

When processing the MST structure, implementations must verify the layer assignment and ordering of keys. While this verification is most essential for untrusted inputs, implementations should perform these checks consistently regardless of data source. Additional validation of node size limits and other structural parameters is required to prevent resource exhaustion attacks, as detailed in Security Considerations ({{security}}).

## MST Construction Example {#mst-example}

The following is a Merkle Search Tree containing 9 records with keys A-I. Each key would include a pointer to some record hash, though that hash is irrelevant to the construction of the tree. Each asterisk (`*`) represents a hash pointer to the subtree under it.

For the sake of illustration assume the following layer calculations:

- `layer(D) = 2`
- `layer(A|E|I) = 1`
- `layer(B|C|F|G|H) = 0`

## Empty Nodes {#mst-empty-nodes}

An empty repository containing no records is represented as a single MST node with no entries. This is the only case where a node without entries is permitted.

Nodes that contain no key entries but do contain subtree links are allowed at intermediate positions, provided those subtrees eventually contain key entries. However, such nodes MUST NOT appear at the root position — the root MUST either contain key entries or be the special case of a completely empty repository. Similarly, nodes without key entries MUST NOT appear at leaf positions except for the empty repository case.

This structure ensures that nodes lacking key-value entries are pruned from the top and bottom of the tree while preserving intermediate nodes that maintain proper height relationships and prevent subtree links from skipping layers.

## MST Node Schema {#mst-nodes}

Given their prevalence through the repository structure, MST nodes require a compact binary representation for storage efficiency. Keys within each node use prefix compression, where each entry specifies the number of bytes it shares with the preceding key in the array. The first entry in each node contains the complete key with a prefix length of zero. This compression applies only within individual nodes and does not extend across node boundaries. The compression scheme is mandatory to ensure deterministic MST structure across all implementations.

MST nodes contain the following fields:

- `l` (hash link, nullable): Reference to a subtree node at a lower layer containing keys that sort lexicographically before all keys in the current node
- `e` (array, required): Ordered array of entry objects, each containing:
    - `p` (integer, required): Number of bytes shared with the previous entry in this node
    - `k` (byte string, required): Key suffix remaining after removing the shared prefix bytes
    - `v` (hash link, required): Reference to the record data for this entry
    - `t` (hash link, nullable): Reference to a subtree node at a lower layer containing keys that sort after this entry's key but before the next entry's key in the current node

Hash references appearing within an MST node — the `l` and `t` subtree links, and the `v` record link — MUST use the constrained content-hash format defined in {{cbor}}. 

## MST Node example {#mst-node-example}

The following example shows an MST node at layer 1 containing two subtree pointers and two key-value entries. The node contents in order are:

- Left subtree: hash link `0x01711220643b9326...`
- Entry: `key7` → record hash link `0x017112202d9aa87e...`
- Right subtree: hash link `0x0171122047e2886f...`
- Entry: `key10` → record hash link `0x0171122010b6da2c...`

This node would be encoded as follows:

~~~json
{
	l: 0x01711220643b9326...
	e: [
		{
			p: 0,
			k: "key7",
			v: 0x017112202d9aa87e...
			t: 0x0171122047e2886f...
		},
		{
			p: 3,
			k: "10",
			v: 0x0171122010b6da2c...
			t: null
		}
	]
}
~~~

# Commit Signatures {#signatures}

Commit objects are signed by the key declared by the repository owner’s resolvable identifier. Neither the signature nor the signed commit object contains information about the curve type or specific public key used for signing. This information must be obtained by resolving the repository's DID as specified in {{account-ids}}.

The most recent commit must always be verifiable using the currently resolvable signing key. When rotating signing keys, a new repository commit must be created, even if the contents and structure of the repository remain unchanged.

## Signature Generation {#sig-gen}

To generate a commit signature:

1. Populate all commit data fields except the `sig` field
2. Serialize the unsigned commit using deterministic CBOR encoding (see {{cbor}})
3. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the serialized bytes
4. Sign the hash using the current signing key associated with the repository's DID
5. Format the signature as a concatenation of the 32-byte `r` and 32-byte `s` values
6. Add the resulting 64-byte signature to the commit object as the `sig` field

## Supported Curves {#sig-curves}

AT implementations must support both of the following elliptic curves and signature algorithms:

- NIST P-256 (also known as secp256r1 or p256) {{SEC2}}
- secp256k1 (also known as k256) {{SEC2}}

## Signature Canonicalization {#sig-canonicalization}

ECDSA signatures exhibit malleability, allowing transformation into distinct but equally valid signatures without access to the private key or original data. While the security impact is limited, signature malleability could enable broadcast of multiple valid versions of the same repository commit with different hashes, potentially causing consumer confusion.

To prevent such scenarios, AT requires all ECDSA signatures to be canonicalized in low-S form. Specifically, the `s` component of the signature must satisfy `s ≤ n/2`, where `n` is the order of the curve's base point.

# Deterministic CBOR Encoding {#cbor}

Repository content requires consistent binary representation across all implementations to ensure identical content hashes and verifiable integrity. All records, MST nodes, and commits must be encoded using Deterministically Encoded CBOR as specified in {{Section 4.2 of CBOR}}, with map key ordering following the original specification in {{Section 3.9 of RFC7049}} for historical compatibility.

The encoding rules described here are compatible with similar deterministic-CBOR profiles such as {{DRISL}}.

The deterministic encoding rules that apply in this specification are:

- Integers are encoded in their shortest form
- All arrays, maps, and strings are encoded with explicit lengths; CBOR's indefinite-length encoding is not used
- Floating-point values are not used; this includes NaN and infinity values
- Map keys are sorted using the legacy length-first ordering of {{Section 3.9 of RFC7049}}
- Maps MUST NOT contain duplicate keys

For interoperability purposes, hash links between repository objects are encoded using a specific format within the CBOR structure. SHA-256 hash links are represented as CBOR byte strings under tag 42, with the byte string containing the 32-byte hash value prefixed by the fixed byte sequence `0x01711220`.

Hash links that point to arbitrary binary data instead of other repository objects should be encoded similarly though prefixed by the fixed byte sequence `0x01551220`.

The four prefix bytes encode (in order): a version byte `0x01`; a codec identifier byte (`0x71` for repository objects encoded with deterministic CBOR; `0x55` for arbitrary raw binary data); a hash-algorithm identifier byte `0x12` indicating SHA-256; and a hash-length byte `0x20` indicating 32 bytes. The 32-byte SHA-256 digest follows.

# Repository Serialization Format {#serialization}

Repositories are serialized for transmission and storage as a concatenated sequence of block data, where blocks represent the CBOR-encoded records, MST nodes, and commit objects that comprise the repository structure. The serialization is prefixed with a header that identifies the root block, typically the repository's commit object.

Serialized repositories may contain partial repository state, such as when transmitting cryptographic proofs for specific records. In these situations, they may not include unrelated MST nodes or records outside the proof path.

## Header Format {#serialization-header}

The header is constructed by CBOR-encoding an object with the following fields:

- `version` (integer, required): Fixed value of `1`
- `root` (array, required): Single-element array containing the hash link of the commit block

The CBOR-encoded header is prefixed with its byte length encoded as an unsigned LEB128 integer as described in Section 5.2.2 of {{WEBASSEMBLY}}.

## Block Format {#serialization-blocks}

Following the header, each repository block is serialized by concatenating:

1. The combined byte length of the following two components, encoded as an unsigned LEB128 integer
2. The block's content hash, prefixed with `0x01711220` as specified in {{cbor}}
3. The CBOR-encoded block data

~~~aasvg
|------- Header -------| |------------------ Data ------------------|
[ int | Header block ] [ int | hash | block ] [ int | hash | block ] …
~~~
{: #f-serialization title="Repo Serialization Layout"}

## Block Ordering {#serialization-ordering}

Producers SHOULD emit blocks in pre-order traversal of the included repository portion: header, commit object, root MST node, then a recursive depth-first interleaving of subtree nodes and the records they reference.

Preorder traversal enables streaming verification of repositories, allowing parsers to walk the MST structure and output key-to-record mappings while maintaining minimal MST state in memory. This approach supports efficient processing of large repositories without requiring complete buffering of the serialized data.

Parsers MUST tolerate other block orderings, duplicate occurrences of the same block, and additional unrelated blocks. Specifically:

- Duplicate blocks SHOULD be deduplicated rather than treated as an error.
- Dangling references — for example, hash links pointing to records or blobs that are not present in the serialized data — MAY be present and unresolvable; this is not an error in itself.
- Unrelated blocks not referenced by the repository structure SHOULD be ignored. Excessive quantities of such blocks MAY be treated as a form of resource abuse; see {{security}}.

The block-and-header layout described here is compatible with content-addressable archive formats such as {{DASL-CAR}}.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Repositories constitute untrusted input as account holders have complete control over repository contents and repository hosts control binary encoding. Implementations must handle potential denial of service vectors from both malicious actors and accidental conditions such as corrupted data or implementation bugs.

## CBOR Processing limits {#security-cbor}

Generic precautions must be followed when processing CBOR data, including enforcement of maximum serialized object size, maximum recursion depth for nested structures, and memory budget limits for deserialized data. While some CBOR implementations include these protections by default, implementations should verify and configure appropriate limits regardless of library defaults.

## MST Structure Attacks {#security-mst}

The efficiency of MST data structures depends on a uniform distribution of key hashes. Since account holders control record keys, they can perform key mining to generate sets of keys with specific layer assignments and sorting characteristics, resulting in inefficient tree structures. Such attacks can cause excessive storage overhead and network amplification during repository transmission.

To mitigate these attacks, implementations should:

- Limit the number of entries per MST node to a statistically reasonable maximum
- Impose limits on overall repository height
- Monitor and restrict other structural parameters that could be exploited through sophisticated key mining

## Repository Import Validation {#security-import}

When importing repositories, implementations should verify the completeness and integrity of the repository structure. Serialized repositories may contain additional unrelated blocks beyond those required for the repository structure. Care should be taken during storage to avoid resource waste on unreferenced blocks and to prevent potential storage exhaustion attacks.
